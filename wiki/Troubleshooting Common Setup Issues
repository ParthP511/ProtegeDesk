# Troubleshooting: Common Setup Issues
This page documents common installation and setup problems and how to resolve them.
If you face an issue not listed here, please open a new issue or update this page.

## 1. Node.js Version Issues
### Problem

- Application fails to start or build

- Errors like Unsupported engine, SyntaxError, or build failures

### Cause

- An incompatible Node.js version is installed

### Solution

1. Check your Node.js version:
```
node -v
```

2. Verify the required Node.js version from the project documentation.

3. Install and use the correct version (recommended: nvm):
```
nvm install <required-version>
nvm use <required-version>
```

4. Reinstall dependencies:
```
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```

## 2. Dependency Conflicts
### Problem

- Errors during npm install or npm run build

- Messages like ERESOLVE or peer dependency conflict

### Cause

- Conflicting package versions or corrupted dependencies

### Solution

1. Remove existing dependencies:
```
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
```

2. Reinstall dependencies:
```
npm install
```

3. If the issue persists:
```
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

4. Use only one package manager (do not mix npm and yarn).

## 3. Environment Variable Setup
### Problem

- App runs but features don’t work

- Errors related to missing configuration

### Cause

- Required environment variables are not set

### Solution

1. Locate .env.example in the repository.

2. Create a .env file:
```
cp .env.example .env
```

3. Fill in all required values.

4. Restart the development server:
```
npm run dev
```
## 4. Build or Runtime Errors
### Problem

- App builds but crashes at runtime

- Blank screen or unexpected behavior

### Cause

- Cached builds or outdated dependencies

### Solution

1. Stop the server.

2. Clean and rebuild:
```
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
npm run build
npm run dev
```

3. Check browser console and terminal logs for details.

## 5. General Tips

1. Read error messages carefully—they usually point to the root cause.

2. Ensure your local setup matches the project documentation.

3. When asking for help, include:

- Node.js version

- Error logs

- Steps to reproduce the issue
